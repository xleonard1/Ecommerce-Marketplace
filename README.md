# Ecommerce-Marketplace

Ecommerce marketplace that allows users to buy and sell items to their peers. 


# Description

A functional and highly immersive application allowing users to buy and sell products online.  A user can create an account and purchase items for sale by other sellers, in addition to creating product listings to sell items to other users of the site.  A product page template is provided to sellers to input item information, and once that is collected, each item will display in the seller's dashboard.
